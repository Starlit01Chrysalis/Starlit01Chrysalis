Object Detection with Sound Alert
Overview
This project implements an object detection system with sound alerts using Google Colab. It uses a pre-trained model to detect objects in real-time and triggers a sound alert upon detection.

Features
Real-time object detection.
Sound alert for specified objects.
Easy setup in Google Colab.
Setup
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-sound-alert.git
cd object-detection-sound-alert
Open in Google Colab:

Open Object_Detection_Sound_Alert.ipynb.
Install Dependencies:


!pip install opencv-python-headless numpy tensorflow
Configure the Model:

Upload a pre-trained model to Colab.
Update the notebook with the model path.
Run the Notebook:

Execute the cells to start object detection and sound alerts.
Usage
Customize detected objects and confidence thresholds in the notebook.
Replace the default sound alert with a custom sound file if desired.
